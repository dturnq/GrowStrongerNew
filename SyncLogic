BEFORE saving the workout, set all workouts, CEs, sets to "Raw Complete"


Run this whenever the view is viewed
1. Lock it so that it cannot be started again
2. Find the oldest "Raw Complete" workout
3. Look for sets that are "Active" from that workout [USED TO BE "RAW COMPLETE"]
- If none, go to PR check step
- else go to Process Raw step


Processing step: Go through all exercises, for each pick the top set; set it to "Pre-processed Best"; remaining sets set to "Fully pre-processed" [NO SAVE] [NOTE: A premiminary protective measure would reorder to rename the others first]
- Go to calc PR step

PR check step: Look for sets in the workout that are "Pre-processed best"
- If None, go to Save all step
- If some, go to Calc PRs step


Calc PRs step: for each set that is "Pre-processed best" (there should only be one per exercise), use a QueryInBackground to get the previous PR (you must filter for sets that are not "Pre-processed best" to ensure you don't return yourself). When it returns, go back to the secondary thread using GCD.
- If fail, then stop and UNLOCK
- If success, then determine whether you have a PR, increment CE / workout, then change status to "Fully Pre-processed". Go to Final Save [DO NOT SAVE]

Final Save: Change status of workout and CEs to "Complete" and save. unlock.
- If fail, UNLOCK

ALTERNATIVE:
View is opened... run SaveWorkouts

Initial set search: Lock, then Find all unsaved sets
- If none, go to CE search
- If some, then saveallinbackground
- Would need clientIDs
- If it fails, I'm going to need to individually check which items saved properly and which didn't
